# Maze Runner Project

This is a simple program created for use on an Arduino.
* Where hardware meets software,
* You will also need 4 buttons, connected to the Arduino, for directional movement of the player,
* You also need a 8x8 LED matrix that will show you the maze that you are moving in.

## How it works

This maze has 7 levels, each one with a different level of difficulty.
* The last 2 levels have enemies moving within the level. One of them is harder than the othe,
* Be careful not to get caught by them, because you will start the game all over again,
* If you finish the game, you will be greeted with a smiley face :), 
* If you lose, then a sad face will appear :(.

## How it looks

Here are some pictures of the setup that i've used for this game project:
